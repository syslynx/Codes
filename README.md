# Codes
Simple code templates to understand logics behind, built to last.

This repository contains simple High-School level codes. Nothing very amazingly interesting, yet I tried to make them so. The algorithms they are based on are quite efficient, and don't really depend upon libraries or functions. Can be implemented to languages such as C or C++ quite easily. I keep on updating them because that's interesting to me, and just might help me in future while I'm busy creating some program... or designing a compiler... maybe :)
